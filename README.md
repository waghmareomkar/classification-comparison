# classification-comparison

description : this repository includes 2 projects, one in python and another in R.

Python- (using SKlearn) A simple comparison of classification algorithms is done in this project. The database used is Titanic dataset from kaggle.Data preprocessing is also done in this project.The whole project is impelmented using python. Code for python and jupyter notebook both are included in this project. 

R - A simple comparison of classification algorithms is done in this project. The database used is heart diesease dataset from University of California, Irvine.The whole project is impelmented using R. Code for R and output graphs are included in this project. 

RMD - A simple R mark down file is also included which does some basic EDA and gains inferences.
